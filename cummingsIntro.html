      I am a senior completing my IT degree this May, here's some facts about me:

    <h2>
      Where I'm From

    <p id="myP"> <!-- This is the myP id -->
      This is Princeton, NJ. Though originally I was born in Colorado, I've lived in NJ as long as I can remember. I enjoy living in NY now though, because of all the great movie theaters.

    <h2>
      What I'm About
    </h2>
    
    <ul>
      <li>I like to watch movies</li>
      <li>I like to play videogames</li>
      <li id="dune">I'm almost finished with God Emporer of Dune</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      I have moviepass, which lets me watch 1 movie in theaters a day, so I try and take advantage of that all the time. Still, it can be pretty hard to get off of my PC when I'm playing a game, but somehow I've managed to almost finish school and see tons of movies, so I guess I must not be too addicted. I like to read, usually Sci-fi and fantasy, for the last year I've been working my way through the Dune series, it's so good. Somehow 4 books in it's still getting better, Frank Herbert was a genius. I'm a pretty lazy guy, but I don't mind being lazy since I usually get my work done and am satisfied with the quality. I also went vegetarian a couple months ago, somehow I'm still doing it, so I guess it's not really that hard after all. I like online classes because I'd rather just do the research and projects on my own time, rather than have to sit around in a classroom for a couple hours.

      Programming Experience
    </h2>
    
    <p>
      I've taken various self tutorials on web design, like codeacademy and treehouse, as well as a class at Pace. I'd like to keep learning about web development though, because I still feel like I have a lot to learn, and creating web pages is a creative way to spend some time. It might also be helpful in the future, I'm more interested in data analytics, but being proficcient in web design could come in handy and make me more versatile.
